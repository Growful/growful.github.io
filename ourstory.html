                    Plants have an array of benefits; from improving mental health and increasing productivity, to purifying indoor air by absorbing toxins and producing oxygen, plants are fantastic additions to any home.</p>
                <p>Our aim is to work in harmony with the environment, which we believe is extremely important in this modern age. With all our products locally sourced, we are not only supporting small businesses, but we are reducing the size of our carbon footprint by avoiding the emissions of international shipping. Our eco-friendly seed paper is also made from biodegradable cotton and the variety of seeds on offer are tailored to saving the bees.</p>
                <p>Sending cards has never been more important, reminding people that you are thinking of them in these tough times. We aim to build and strengthen relationships through personalised handmade greeting cards and a plantable gift box. </p>

                <p><strong style="font-size: 145%">More Than Just a Logo</strong>
                    <br>
                    We are living in uprecendented times and many of us have suffered greatly as a result. Here at Growful we believe the pandemic has highlighted the issues and challenges we face as a society. As young group of individuals we set out with the goal of bringing a light to these difficult times. Our company stands for three key principles. Firstly, operating as a company in harmony with the environment. Secondly, enabling small local bussinesses to flourish. Finally, the core of all our principles is to enable relationships to not only thrive but to grow as well.</p>
                <div class="has-content-centered">
                    <img src="/imgs/logoexplanation.png" style="width: 70%; height: 10%">
                </div>
                <p><strong style="font-size: 145%">Sustainability</strong>
                    <br>
                    From the moment we formed the company we have had sustainability in mind when making decisions. It is an issue that everyone on this planet is faced with, ensuring that we are all doing our bit to protect the world we live in is not a goal it is a responsibility. As a result, we strive to minimise the impact we have on the environment, no matter how small it is.  
                    <br>
                    Experts are predicting that there isn't much time until we will have reached a point of no return as our planet can no longer be saved. We saw the amount of waste involved in the gift industry and we wanted to give people the opportunity to step in and do their bit to save the environment. Many large gift services like Moonpig and Funky Pigeon do very little to minimise the damage they inflict on the environment. The large amounts of waste that is caused through the gift industry is far higher than it has to be. We offer a sustainable alternative that works with the environment, not against it.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size: 145%">Relationships</strong>
                    <br>
                    Our mission at Growful is to promote building relationships between individuals, we think it is essential part of society and there has never been a time when building and maintaining those relationships has been so important. The simple act of giving a card or a gift can have an incredibly positive impact on a relationship. The social impact of gifts is often greatly underestimated, in this rapidly growing technological world. When it is so much more convenient to send a text, we must ensure that people understand the positive impact that a bit of extra time and effort can have on someone’s personal wellbeing.  
                    <br>
                    Customers are able to send a gift that lives on through plants that grow from it. This not only serves as a metaphor of the effect that the gift has had on you. The gift also blossoms into flowers which in itself can improve the wellbeing of an individual. We are advocates for positive social change within society, we want a better society and this is something we hold at the core of our company.  </p>
                <p><strong style="font-size: 145%">Local Businesses</strong>
                    <br>
                    Few have been as badly affected by the pandemic as much as the small local businesses we love. We want to protect them as they navigate these difficult times. We aim to do this by finding local sustainable companies and incorporating their products in our gift boxes. Via this process we are able to help companies to reach a far larger market than they currently are able to. We are incredibly exited to announce our first official partnership, with Hay meadow farm. Hay meadow farm is a small family run business with a very small market reach, we are able to get their product out to a much larger audience. Both selling their product and spreading awareness of their company. We will work closely with the companies we partner with to ensure sustainability is at the core of everything we do.</p>
