                <p>Unlike any other, our Growful Gift box is tailored to you and is fully customisable, all for only <strong>£15</strong>. With all gifts locally sourced it is the perfect gift to any relative this Spring! Our brand new card, along with a Growful gift box, makes for a unique, memorable gift, which is perfect for cultivating your relationships again as we move towards our more normal, social lives.</p>
                <p>You can choose four out of our range of seven products. From the sweet aroma of the votive Lavender candles, to the various handmade soaps, to some luxurious bamboo straws, there are so many deluxe products to choose from!</p>
                <p>The Growful gift box also comes with an expandable coco coir growing medium and a seed paper Card, which you can plant within the box to have colourful flowers blossoming within your own home.</p>

            <div class="markdown">
                <p>Our Growful gift box contains coco coir underneath the gift items. After removing your chosen eco-friendly gifts and the environmentally sourced wax paper, simply adding water will turn the coco coir into a fantastic medium for growing small plants, such as the wildflowers that grow from our seed paper cards. You can simply bury the seed paper card in the expanded, damp coco coir and by keeping it warm, moist and with plenty of access to light, it will eventually bloom into wildflowers.</p>

                <p>Bring the warm embrace of mother nature into your home, with our premium lavender candles. Candles like these have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety. Moreover, these candles burn for up 10 hours, perfect for snuggling up with a good book as many times as you need. You’re probably wondering how a candle this small burns for so long. Once it’s placed within a candle holder, the candle will begin to liquify. The wax burns evenly all the way to the bottom of the holder. This is how the candles are able to burn for 10 whole hours.</p>

                <p>The entire above-ground portion of the plant can be used (However we only sell the dried flower).  The flowers are edible and can be used raw to top salads. The chamomile flowers are also often dried and used in tea or added to the bath. They may also be pressed for their oil. The leaves are dried and used in aromatherapy and other herbal medicines.</p>
                <p>It may surprise you just how many things you can do with chamomile. For example, at Juni in Manhattan, pastry chef Mina Pizzaro infuses the flower into ice cream, highlighted with yuzu and ginger. To get the flavour of the chamomile out of the plant and into the dessert, Pizzaro steeps it in cream for hours prior to churning. “The flavour lends a natural gentle sweetness and pleasant floral notes to the dessert,” she says, adding that the spiciness of ginger and acidity of yuzu help to strike a perfect balance.</P>
                <p>Chamomile works in non-dessert applications as well, as chef Craig Richards has done in Atlanta at St. Cecilia. His pièce de résistance: scallop crudo with chamomile-celery oil. “We decided to use chamomile because it’s a unique ingredient you don’t see very often in savoury cooking,” he says. “It brings another element of acidity and herbal flavour that plays very well with raw fish, especially the natural sweetness of the raw scallop.” Richards has developed a technique for extracting the plant’s flavour as well. “We blend it for an extended period of time so that it heats up in the blender and releases its essential oil.” He also suggests making a dried chamomile and salt rub for fish and throwing some fresh blossoms in a spring salad.</p>
                <p><strong>Currently our first batch of chamomile tea flowers are from Egypt, coming through our UK-based supplier. Our supplier assures us that the next batches will not be imported.</strong></p>
